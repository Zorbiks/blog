                    Before making any bad assumptions, let me clarify that I'm not dismissing the importance of attending college. It's still a valuable investment in one's education and can provide a competitive edge in the job market. However, I'd like to share my personal experience as a recent graduate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is university a waste of time? The answer depends on various factors. In my case, attending a public university was an okay experience, which I'd rate as 5 out of 10 for several reasons.

                    <h2>3 Years Curriculum to Become a Web Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    That's Insane, Right? I know what you're thinking: "What the heck were you studying?" Well, the curriculum had a lot of modules, covering topics from algorithms to data structures and programming languages like C, C++, Java, and frontend languages, but unfortunately, most of these were on paper and mostly theoretical, with no practical projects to demonstrate our skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the final semester, you are required to complete a capstone project. Many students are advised or even forced to make this project a web application. This is unfair, considering that over the course of three years, you have learned a wide range of technologies, only to become a web developer in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>The First Year</h2>
                <p>
                    The first year, in my opinion, was an actual waste of time because we didn't do much CS. There were only two modules in the whole year that were related to computers at all. The first one, in the first semester, was an introduction to CS where we did the basic stuff like what's a computer and its components. We did binary and other numerical bases and an introduction to networking related to masks and subnets. Then, in the second semester, we did an introduction to algorithms, basic stuff like fundamental concepts like variables, conditions, and loops, and we studied some sorting algorithms like bubble sort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the rest of the year, we studied maths and physics. Now, don't get me wrong, both are important and maths is even more important, but come on, what would a CS student do with thermodynamics or electromagnetism? Nothing! Unless you're going to make a program that simulates properties, but other than that, there's no reason for it. So, in total, you got 12 modules in the year, two of them are related to computer science. What a waste of time!
                </p>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Also, there isn't much to study, really. You could skip classes, go to the exam, and pass or even get a good mark. I'm not joking. If I were to estimate the time it would take to complete all the modules, I would say it would take one and a half years, to cover the three years' worth of material if we removed all the unnecessary modules. That's quite the optimization, right? Because, really, you are given a lecture once a week, and each lecture is only one and a half hours long. Just imagine it: imagine studying C once a week on YouTube. Think about how boring that would be and how much time you are wasting.

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, go to university, but don't rely on it too much. Look up things on the internet; there are a lot of useful resources. The only thing that is missing is people with the same mindset to discuss with and proper guidance.
